# 🚀 Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **machine learning-based fraud detection system** that analyzes transaction data to identify fraudulent activities.  

### Features:  
✅ A **Flask API** for processing fraud detection requests.  
✅ A **React-based frontend** for uploading transaction data.  
✅ An **XGBoost-based ML model** for real-time fraud detection.  
✅ **AWS-hosted backend** and **Vercel-hosted frontend** for seamless deployment.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  

### 🔹 Backend (Flask API)  
- **Flask** – Handles API requests  
- **TensorFlow, XGBoost, Scikit-learn** – Fraud detection models  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing  
- **AWS** – Hosting backend API  

### 🔹 Machine Learning Model  
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost, trained for fraud detection  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transaction history, fraud risk patterns, anomaly detection  
- **Model Deployment:** Served via Flask API  

### 🔹 Frontend (React Dashboard)  
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** – Fast and dynamic UI  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Responsive design  
- **Node.js** – Manages API interactions  
- **Vercel** – Hosting the frontend

## 📊 How It Works  
1. **User uploads a CSV file** with transaction data.  
2. **Backend processes data** and passes it through the ML model.  
3. **XGBoost model predicts fraud risk** for each transaction.  
4. **Dashboard displays results** with fraud indicators and insights.

## 🔍 Future Enhancements  
✅ Implement **real-time fraud alerts** via email/SMS.  
✅ Enhance **feature engineering** with external risk factors.  
✅ Optimize model with **deep learning techniques** (LSTMs, autoencoders).
