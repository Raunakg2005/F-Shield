# Fraud Detection System 🚀
📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning-based fraud detection system that analyzes transaction data to identify fraudulent activities. The system features:
✅ A Flask API for processing fraud detection requests.
✅ A React-based frontend for uploading transaction data.
✅ An XGBoost-based ML model for detecting fraud in real time.
✅ AWS-hosted backend and Vercel-hosted frontend for seamless deployment.

📊 How It Works
1️⃣ User uploads a CSV file with transaction data.
2️⃣ Backend processes data and passes it through the ML model.
3️⃣ XGBoost model predicts fraud risk for each transaction.
4️⃣ Dashboard displays results with fraud indicators and insights.

🔍 Future Enhancements
✅ Implement real-time fraud alerts via email/SMS.
✅ Enhance feature engineering with external risk factors.
✅ Optimize model with deep learning techniques (LSTMs, autoencoders).
